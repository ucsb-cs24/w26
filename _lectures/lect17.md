# Topics
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms
 - Subdivide a larger problem into smaller problems
 - Solve each smaller part
 - Combine solutions of smaller sub problems back into the larger problem

* Mergesort as an example of efficient sorting algo that uses the divide and conquer approach and runs in O(n log n)
* Practice by solving leetcode problem
