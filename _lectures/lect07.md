# Topics
* Big-O analysis of BST operations: connecting height to running time                                             
* Best case (balanced) vs worst case (skewed) BST heights                                                         
* Choosing traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder — when to use which                                           
* Writing recursive BST functions: three approaches to isBST (naive → bottom-up → top-down)                       
* Top-down vs bottom-up problem solving on trees                                                                  
* Skipping unnecessary work: data-driven (BST property) vs progress-driven (early termination)
