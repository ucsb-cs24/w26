Watch the first 5 minutes of this intro video to Neural Networks: <https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?feature=shared>

# Topics
* Graph: terminology and application to modeling neural networks
* Representation: adjacency list 
* Connections to implementing a neural network (topic for pa03)
* Visualizing how a neural net is stored in memory and supporting data structures
* Designing the Graph class to allow building the graph iteratively by calling functions to add nodes and edges.
* PA03 starter code for in class activity: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-s25/STARTER-pa03>
