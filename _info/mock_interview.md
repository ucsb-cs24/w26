# Mock Interview Guide

## Overview

Mock interviews are worth **10% of your course grade** and provide an opportunity to practice technical problem-solving and communication skills in a supportive environment. You will complete one 20-minute mock interview with a TA or ULA during Weeks 3-10. You must book your slot by end of Week 2.

**Timeline:**
- **By end of Week 2**: Submit booking preferences form (link will be posted on course website)
- **Weeks 5-10**: Complete your scheduled 20-minute mock interview

**Important:** Book early! Slots fill up quickly with 200+ students. No make-ups without prior arrangement. Missing your scheduled interview = 0%.

## What to Expect

Your mock interview will consist of:

1. **Introduction & Behavioral Warm-Up (2 minutes)** - Brief introduction and discussion of a technical challenge you've solved
2. **Whiteboard Problem (5 minutes)** - Plan your approach to a LeetCode problem on a whiteboard or document
3. **Coding Implementation (13 minutes)** - Implement your solution in C++ on LeetCode
4. **Structured Feedback (5 minutes)** - Receive feedback on your performance and ask questions

---

## How to Prepare

1. **Practice LeetCode problems** - Complete the assigned problem sets (lp01-lp05)
2. **Think out loud** - Get comfortable explaining your thought process while solving problems
3. **Review data structures** - Know key concepts: linked lists, trees, hash tables, stacks, queues, graphs
4. **Prepare your introduction** - Have a brief introduction ready and think of a technical challenge you've solved
5. **Practice whiteboarding** - Draw out your approach before coding

## What is Expected During the Interview

### 1. Introduction & Behavioral (2 minutes)
- Introduce yourself professionally
- Discuss a recent technical challenge you solved and your approach
- Be clear, concise, and connect your experience to computer science

### 2. Whiteboard Problem (5 minutes)
You will be asked to:
- **Restate the problem** in your own words
- **Ask clarifying questions** about inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases
- **Draw diagrams** to visualize your approach
- **Create a test case** and walk through how it would work
- **Discuss your approach** before coding (consider trade-offs, time/space complexity)
- **Think out loud** - keep the interviewer informed of your reasoning

**Key Points:**
- Don't jump straight to coding
- Consider multiple approaches
- Identify edge cases
- Use diagrams or pseudocode to organize your thoughts

### 3. Coding Implementation (13 minutes)
- Translate your whiteboard approach into working C++ code on LeetCode
- **Continue thinking out loud** - narrate what you're doing and why
- Use the test case you created to verify your solution
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Handle edge cases you identified during whiteboarding
- Be open to hints and feedback from the interviewer

### 4. Feedback & Discussion (5 minutes)
- Receive constructive feedback on your performance
- Discuss strengths and areas for improvement
- Ask questions about the problem or your approach
- Consider how you might optimize or improve your solution

## Grading Rubric (10% of course grade)

Your performance will be evaluated across three sections. **The focus is on process and communication, not just correctness.**

### Section 1: Behavioral/Introduction

| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations (3) | Meets Expectations (2) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Clarity & Relevance** | Clear, concise, and relevant; connects experience to CS | Mostly clear and relevant; some connection to CS | Unclear, off-topic, or rambling |
| **Confidence & Professionalism** | Speaks confidently, maintains eye contact, positive tone | Some hesitancy, but generally professional | Hesitant, unprofessional, or negative tone |
| **Reflection & Growth** | Shares a specific challenge or learning moment | Shares general experience | No reflection or learning discussed |

### Section 2: Whiteboarding (Problem Understanding & Approach)

| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations (3) | Meets Expectations (2) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Problem Clarification** | Restates problem, asks clarifying questions, identifies edge cases, works through examples | Restates problem, some clarifications, some edge cases | Misses clarifications, ignores edge cases |
| **Approach & Planning** | Explains and justifies logical, efficient approach; considers alternatives; clear progression | Explains reasonable approach; some jumps in reasoning | Jumps to code, unclear or inefficient plan |
| **Communication** | Clearly explains thought process throughout; states goals and subgoals | Explains most steps; addresses some reasoning | Silent or unclear explanations |
| **Use of Diagrams/Pseudocode** | Uses diagrams or pseudocode effectively | Some use of diagrams/pseudocode | No diagrams or pseudocode |

### Section 3: Coding (Implementation & Testing)

| Criteria | Exceeds Expectations (3) | Meets Expectations (2) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Code Correctness** | Code is correct, handles all edge cases | Mostly correct, minor issues | Major errors, incomplete |
| **Code Structure & Style** | Clean, readable code; good variable names; proper indentation | Some indentation/readability issues; acceptable variable names | Messy, hard to read, poor conventions |
| **Adaptability** | Responds well to hints, adapts approach if needed | Accepts some feedback | Resists feedback, stuck on errors |
| **Communication** | Narrates coding process clearly | Explains some steps | Silent or unclear during coding |
| **Comfort with C++** | Familiar with lecture concepts; minimal syntax help needed | Needed some syntax/error assistance | Unfamiliar with C++; relied heavily on external help |

### Grade Calculation

Your final grade out of 10% will be based on your overall performance across all criteria:

- **9-10%**: Excellent performance - exceeds expectations in most criteria; strong problem-solving and communication
- **7-8%**: Good performance - meets or exceeds expectations in most criteria; solid effort and communication
- **5-6%**: Satisfactory performance - meets expectations in some criteria; shows understanding and effort
- **3-4%**: Minimal performance - needs improvement in most areas; shows up and tries but struggles
- **0-2%**: Unsatisfactory - no-show, refuses to participate, or extreme lack of engagement

## Tips for Success

**Do:**
- ✓ Think out loud - explain your reasoning as you work
- ✓ Ask clarifying questions about the problem
- ✓ Start with a plan before coding
- ✓ Use diagrams and examples to visualize your approach
- ✓ Test your solution with the examples you created
- ✓ Be open to hints and feedback
- ✓ Stay positive and engaged even if you get stuck

**Don't:**
- ✗ Jump straight to coding without planning

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I can't solve the problem completely?**
A: That's okay! You're evaluated on your approach and communication, not just correctness. Partial solutions with good reasoning can still earn a high grade.

**Q: Can I use notes or references during the interview?**
A: No, the interview simulates a real technical interview where you won't have access to external resources. You should rely on what you've learned in class.

**Q: What difficulty level will the problem be?**
A: The problem will be a medium-difficulty LeetCode problem aligned with recent lecture topics. Your interviewer will select an unsolved problem from your LeetCode profile.

**Q: Can I reschedule my interview?**
A: You may reschedule at least 48 hours before your interview time if an open slot is available. Last-minute cancellations may not be accommodated.

**Q: Will I know the problem beforehand?**
A: No, you'll receive the problem during the interview via Canvas message. This simulates a real interview experience.

**Q: What if I get very nervous?**
A: That's normal! Remember this is a learning experience in a supportive environment. Take deep breaths, think out loud, and do your best. Your interviewer wants you to succeed.
