## Collaboration policy
This lab must be done individually and is in lieu of lab04. Note that no late submissions will be accepted for this lab (so late days don't apply).

## Description
Please navigate to lab08 on gradescope and work to complete the complexity problems.

# Additional practice problems 
Refer back to the leet code practice problems at the end of lab02 and analysize the space and time complexity of your solution to each problem. Note that additional practice problems don't have a due date.
