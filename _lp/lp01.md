## Additional Practice with linked lists

Note: A maximum of two medium difficulty problems from this problem set will count toward the 10% overall grade for Leet Code problems. Submit direct links to your solution for at least 2 problems on the assignment on Gradescope by the due date..

1. Reverse a singly linked list (easy): <https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/>. Note that in lecture 1 we coded an iterative implementation for problem #1. Try solving the same problem recursively. 
2. Merge two sorted lists(easy): <https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/>
3. Remove duplicates from sorted lists (easy): <https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/>
4. Middle of the Linked List (easy): <https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/>
5. Delete Node in a Linked List (medium): <https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/>
6. Insert Greatest Common Divisor in a Linked List (medium): <https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-greatest-common-divisors-in-linked-list/description/>
