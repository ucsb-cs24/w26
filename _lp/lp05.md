## Optional challenge (not included on exams):
6. Minimum Operations to convert number (medium) <https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-number/description/>
Although this is a good problem, there is a constraint that is somewhat obscure, which is that when viewing the problem as a graph, all node values except for the goal must be between 0 and 3000, and this constraint is used to figure out which paths through the graph from start to goal and invalid.
